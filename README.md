> ## Improvements

Due to the lake of time to implement everything I had in mind, I'll just explain what I would do before promoting this application to production:

- The code coverage should be analyzed to add tests to improve its percentage. A good practice is to keep the coverage up to 80%;

- I would create a file .env to configure all environment variables;

- The applications have some problems that need attention as the reset function to reset all the states after the clock is finished;

- Should be interesting, depending on new requirements to transform the Countdonw Timer into a hook to be more efficient and clear.

- Due to the lake of time, I used the library `moment-timezone` to calculate the new dates, because it is a well tested and easy to use library. As the requirements didnÂ´t mentioned that third party librarys weren't forbidden, I thought this is wasn't an issue.

- The code need an improvement to configure media queries to make the layout responsive and to better fit big screens as flat TV's.
